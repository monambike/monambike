### PROJECTS
#### Hosted on GitHub:
Projects that I was able to host using GitHub.
- [Virtual Restaurant](https://monambike.github.io/virtualrestaurant_web)
- [Yotsuki](https://monambike.github.io/yotsuki_web)

#### Not hosted on GitHub:
These projects couldn't have been hosted because they were made using php. Even being harder, I would appreciate if you take a bit of your time to look them too.
